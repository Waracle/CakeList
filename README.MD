Coding Test (fictitious)


***
NOTE: PLEASE DO NOT USE THIRD PARTY LIBRARIES. However, feel free to state which third party libraries you might have used.
***

Here you'll find the code for a simple mobile app to browse cakes. Unfortunately, the developer who wrote this code is no longer employed by the company as we had some concerns over his ability. The project compiles but the app crashes as soon as it runs.
The app loads a JSON feed containing a repeated list of cakes, with title, image and description from a URL, then displays the contents of the feed in a scrollable list.
We would like you to fix the crash bug, ensure the functionality of the app works as expected (all images display correctly on the table, all text is readable) and performs smoothly (ideally, this should be done without third party libraries).
Additionally, feel free to refactor and optimise the code where appropriate. Ideally, what we'd be looking for is:
● Simple fixes for crash bug(s)
● Application to support rotation
● Safe and efficient loading of images
● Removal of any redundant code
● Refactoring of code to best practices
The test should take around 2 hours, certainly no longer than 3 hours. Good luck!
